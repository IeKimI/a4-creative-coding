## 3D Audio Visualizer

https://a4-eri-kim.glitch.me/

This application is a 3D Audio Visualizer. When you upload an audio file (.wav, .mp3, or .mp4), it directs you to a 3d audio visualizer.
You can also change a few settings such as x, y, z, color, or wireframe using the tweakpane on the top right corner. 
When an audio file is not uploaded, the default audio - GoodVibes.mp3 - will be played.
The biggest challenge when creating this application was learning how to use tweakpane to control three.js parameters. However, enough resources were available online to overcome the challenge.
